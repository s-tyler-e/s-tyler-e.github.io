      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Remember the last time you really wanted to go out and do something but had no idea where to start? In a world of technology and an increased desire to get things as fast as possible, sometimes there are too many options. Often, this can be discouraging and kills the fun before it even starts.

        This is where I come in. My new website is an interactive survey that any user can contribute a small amount of information about themselves. You “tell” it what you like, what you hate, how far you want to go, how many people you’re with, how much or little money you’d like to send, and other such info. Then, let the magic begin!
        
        The program processes the information you provide and gives you a list of activities and places that fit your needs!

        Why waste time browsing when you could be playing? Try it now!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Listen up, you young lovebirds and cliques. This site is all about YOU. Now, I'm not dumb; I know you've been in a situation like mentioned above.
          Not to worry! This website will save you. Why waste time awkwardly wondering what to do when you could get ready, get set, and go?

        Ready, Set, Go! is all about convenience and fun! I have personally been in situations where I have simply had no idea what to do. This happens to individuals and groups alike. This site provides a way to overcome the dreaded question of “…now what?”
        Boredom is the enemy of…well, a lot of things, really. When is the last time you heard any sane person talk about how excited they are to be bored out of their mind?
        May I be so bold as to assume that you have not?
        Well, you’re in luck; me neither. 

        Sir Isaac Newton was a renowned scientist who did cool ‘n’ groovy work in the calculus and physics department. The first law of motion, as he taught it, went a little something like this:
        An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
        Let’s hear it for science words.
        In English (or, at least, according to me), Isaac was simply describing what happens to people who sit around with nothing to do. 
        That’s right!
        They continue to sit around with—you guessed it—nothing to do. 
        So sad.
        However, there is another part of this equation:
        People who are cool and have fun will continue to, a) be cool and b) have fun. 
        Why be bored and sad when you can have fun and be happy?

      <h3>Form</h3>
      <p>
        This website is very simple:
        Fill out the form and go where the ‘wind’ takes you. 
        Of course, by “go where the ‘wind’ takes you”, I mean “do what the results of the survey tell you to do”. Easy!
        All you need is your age, a location, a time frame, a friend (or an acquaintance at the VERY least), your social security number, your credit card information, your mother’s maiden name, the name of your first pet—
        Woah, woah! I’m kidding! Relax!
        Your age, a general location, and a time frame will be just fine. The site will ask for a zip code and when you want to do whatever fate has in store for you to do. The age input is to prevent inappropriate activities to appear to those who are ineligible (that’s right, college kids. Leave the kiddy pool for the kiddies!). 
        In all seriousness, safety is the priority here. Fun is a close second. Very close.
        Once the needed info is provided, viola! The site results provide you with a list of the top ten activities in your area and directions to get to each. They are ranked according to distance, time availability, and popularity (determined by other review providers. Ready, Set, Go! Is not affiliated with those other sites. yuck). If one wishes, one can also filter the results by any of those factors in whatever order is desired.
        Sadly, this website is not developed to the point where you can magically make any activity ever thought of just come to existence wherever you are. Activities are potentially limited by location, and as mentioned before, eligibility. We also don’t recommend forcing your good buddy Joe into doing something he has a deadly fear of (chin up, Joe. There are plenty of other cool and fun things to do besides upside-down ice fishing).

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        “Wait a minute,” I hear you ask. Okay, not really. That would be creepy. 
        “Wait a minute,” I hypothetically and/or metaphorically hear you ask. “Can’t I just put an activity into a map app on my phone?”
        I mean, of course, you could do that. 
        You could also eat a stick. But why on earth would you ever do that?
        You wouldn’t, assuming you’re not of the Castoridae variety.
        The point of this website is to eliminate the “middleman” that is having to come up with an activity to do in the first place. It’s a bit like rolling the dice. Why not take a chance?

        “Well, what about my privacy?”
        This is a very safe site. Trust me.
        Okay, fine, it’s deeper than that. For two reasons:
        1)	The information you provide is generalized. The site asks for an age range (never an exact age), a zip code (general vicinity), and what time you want to do things (not exactly the most classified information. Unless, of course, you’re a secret agent. If that’s the case, you should probably get your assignments elsewhere!).
        2)	The website only stores your information until you close it!
