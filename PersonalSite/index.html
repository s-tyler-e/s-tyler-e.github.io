                <h2>"Well... now what?"</h2>
                <p>Ready, Set, Go! is all about convenience and fun! I have personally been in situations where I have simply had no idea what to do. This happens to individuals and groups alike. This site provides a way to overcome the dreaded question of “…now what?” Boredom is the enemy of…well, a lot of things, really.</p>
                <p>When was the last time you heard any sane person talk about how excited they were to be bored out of their mind? May I be so bold as to assume that you have not? Well, you’re in luck; me neither.</p>
                <p>Sir Isaac Newton was a renowned scientist who did cool ‘n’ groovy work in the calculus and physics department. The first law of motion, as he taught it, went a little something like this: An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. Let’s hear it for science words.</p>
                <p>In English (or, at least, according to me), Isaac was simply describing what happens to people who sit around with nothing to do. That’s right! They continue to sit around with—you guessed it—nothing to do. So sad. However, there is another part of this equation: People who are cool and have fun will continue to, a) be cool and b) have fun.</p>
                <p>Why be bored and sad when you can have fun and be happy?</p>
